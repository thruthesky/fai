# Dart Tutorials Page

## Overview

The Dart tutorials section provides comprehensive guides for building applications using the Dart language. The page is organized into three primary learning pathways.

## Learn the Basics

This section assumes foundational familiarity with Dart syntax. Key recommendations include:

- **Asynchronous Programming**: "Use streams to manage sequences of data" through dedicated tutorials on async/await patterns and stream handling
- **Package Management**: Resources for organizing and sharing code on pub.dev

The tutorials emphasize understanding futures, iterables, streams, and packages as fundamental concepts for most Dart development.

## Build Server-Side Apps

Four focused tutorials support development of standalone applications:

1. **Getting Started** - Installation, creating simple apps, running in the Dart VM, and AOT compilation to native code
2. **Command-Line Development** - Features essential for CLI applications
3. **Internet Data Fetching** - Using the http package to retrieve remote data
4. **HTTP Server Implementation** - Building web servers in Dart

## Keep Learning

Additional resources include:

- Language cheatsheet highlighting unique Dart features
- Records and patterns codelab
- Iterable collections analysis and manipulation
- Flutter integration tutorials
