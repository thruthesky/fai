# Books about Dart

## Overview

The Dart website maintains a curated collection of books covering the Dart programming language. The page includes a helpful warning: "If you find a Dart book not listed on this page, check for publication dates after June 2021. Older books lack coverage of Dart 2 and 3 topics such as strong typing, null safety, FFI, the `dart` command-line utility, and new developer tools."
