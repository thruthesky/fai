# Tutorials: Command-line Apps and Servers

## Overview

The Dart documentation offers a curated collection of tutorials for developing scripts, command-line applications, and server-side programs that execute within the standalone Dart virtual machine.

## Available Tutorials

### 1. Get Started
This foundational tutorial covers essential setup steps: installing Dart, creating a simple standalone application, executing it through the Dart VM, and compiling it to native machine code using ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

### 2. Write Command-Line Apps
This guide explores the specific features and capabilities required when building command-line applications in Dart, preparing developers to handle typical use cases for terminal-based tools.

### 3. Fetch Data from the Internet
This tutorial demonstrates how to retrieve information from remote sources using the HTTP package, a fundamental skill for applications requiring network communication.

### 4. Write HTTP Servers
This module provides instruction on implementing web servers directly in Dart, enabling developers to build backend services and APIs.
