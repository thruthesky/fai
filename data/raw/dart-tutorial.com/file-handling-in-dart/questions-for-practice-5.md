# Dart File Handling Practice Questions

## Overview
This section contains seven exercises designed to build proficiency with file operations in Dart, covering essential concepts such as writing, appending, reading, copying, and deleting files.

## Practice Exercises

### Question 1: Writing to a File
"Write a dart program to add your name to "hello.txt" file."

This introductory exercise focuses on creating and writing content to a text file using Dart's file handling capabilities.

### Question 2: Appending Content
"Write a dart program to append your friends name to a file that already has your name."

This exercise builds upon the first by teaching how to add new content to an existing file without overwriting previous data.

### Question 3: Accessing Directory Information
"Write a dart program to get the current working directory."

Learners practice retrieving system directory paths, a fundamental operation for file management workflows.

### Question 4: Copying Files
"Write a dart program to copy the "hello.txt" file to "hello_copy.txt" file."

This exercise demonstrates duplicating file content, with the expectation that the original file exists beforehand.

### Question 5: Batch File Creation
"Write a dart program to create 100 files using loop."

This problem teaches loop implementation combined with file creation to handle multiple file operations programmatically.

### Question 6: Deleting Files
"Write a dart program to delete the file "hello_copy.txt". Make sure you have created the file "hello_copy.txt."

Learners practice file deletion operations, with a prerequisite that the target file must exist first.

### Question 7: CSV Data Management
"Write a dart program to store name, age, and address of students in a csv file and read it."
