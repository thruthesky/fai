# Question For Practice 2 - Dart Tutorial

## Overview

This page presents a collection of practice problems for learners studying Dart's conditions and loops. The exercises are designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

## Practice Questions

The tutorial lists nine programming challenges:

1. **Odd/Even Check** - Create a program determining if a number has even or odd parity
2. **Vowel/Consonant Classification** - Build logic to categorize alphabetic characters
3. **Number Sign Determination** - Identify whether values are positive, negative, or zero
4. **String Repetition** - Output text multiple times using loop constructs
5. **Natural Number Summation** - Calculate the sum of consecutive integers
6. **Single Multiplication Table** - Generate multiplication facts for the number 5
7. **Range Multiplication Tables** - Extend to numbers 1 through 9
8. **Basic Calculator** - Implement arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
9. **Selective Range Output** - Print numbers from 1 to 100 while skipping 41

## Context

These exercises follow the "Conditions and Loops" section of the Dart tutorial and precede the "Functions In Dart" module. They target learners who have completed foundational material covering conditionals, loops, and basic operators.
