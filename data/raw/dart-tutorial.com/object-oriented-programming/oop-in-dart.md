# OOP in Dart

## Overview

"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications."

In Dart OOP, objects represent real-world entities (person, bank account, car, house) with **attributes** (properties like name, age, height) and **behavior** (methods like walk, talk).

## Key Advantages

- Improves code comprehension and usability
- Enhances reusability while reducing system complexity
- Boosts developer productivity
- Simplifies maintenance, modifications, and debugging processes
- Encourages collaborative development
- Minimizes code duplication

## Core OOP Features in Dart

1. **Class** - Blueprint for creating objects
2. **Object** - Instance of a class
3. **Encapsulation** - Data hiding and protection
4. **Inheritance** - Extending class functionality
5. **Polymorphism** - Multiple method implementations
6. **Abstraction** - Simplifying complex systems

## Primary Purpose

"The main purpose of OOP is to break complex problems into smaller objects."

## Important Principles

- OOP operates through objects containing both data and methods
- Differs fundamentally from procedural programming approaches
- Promotes modular, flexible, and extensible code architecture
- Facilitates improved problem comprehension and resolution
