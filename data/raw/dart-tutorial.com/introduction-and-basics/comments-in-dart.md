# Comments in Dart

## Overview

"Comments are the set of statements that are ignored by the dart compiler during program execution." They serve as explanatory text for developers to understand code functionality.

## Benefits of Using Comments

- Provide clear code descriptions
- Help other developers understand your code more easily

## Comment Types in Dart

Dart supports three distinct comment formats:

1. **Single-Line Comments** - Use `//` for single lines
2. **Multi-Line Comments** - Use `/* */` for multiple lines
3. **Documentation Comments** - Use `///` for code documentation

## Single-Line Comments

Single-line comments begin with `//`:

```dart
void main() {
  // This is single-line comment.
  print("Welcome to Technology Channel.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to Technology Channel.
```

## Multi-Line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`:

```dart
void main(){
  /*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  */
  print("Welcome to Technology Channel.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to Technology Channel.
```

## Documentation Comments

Documentation comments begin with `///` and are used when creating code documentation:

```dart
void main(){
  /// This is documentation comment
  print("Welcome to Technology Channel.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to Technology Channel.
```
