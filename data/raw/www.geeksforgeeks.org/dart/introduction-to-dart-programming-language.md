# Introduction to Dart Programming Language

## Overview

Dart is a contemporary programming language created by Google for both server-side and client-side development. The SDK provides a compiler, virtual machine, and dart2js utility for JavaScript conversion, enabling cross-platform execution.

## Key Features

1. **Familiar Syntax**: Resembles C# and Java, supporting code reuse and clean program structure
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements OOP principles like Java and C++
3. **Open Source**: Freely available for individual and organizational use
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers via dart2js compilation
5. **Type Safety**: Combines static and runtime type checking
6. **Flexible Compilation**: Supports both JIT and AOT compilation modes
7. **Asynchronous Support**: Enables responsive programs handling concurrent operations

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download the Dart SDK from the official website or use platform-specific installers. Installation varies by operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).

### Hello World Example

```dart
main() {
  print("Hello World!");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

### Program Explanation

- **main()**: Entry point function executed by the compiler
- **print()**: Built-in function displaying output to standard streams

Programs compile via terminal: `dart filename.dart`

## Development Environment

### IDE Support

WebStorm, IntelliJ, and Eclipse support Dart development. WebStorm is available across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Online Alternative

DartPad provides browser-based coding without local installation.

## Dart and Flutter Integration

Flutter, Google's SDK for native app development, uses Dart as its official language. Dart eliminates separate layout languages (JSX, XML), providing readable, user-friendly syntax for Android, iOS, and web applications.
